Title: Supervised scores for cluster analysis results
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Selin", "Jessa", email = "selin.jessa@mail.mcgill.ca", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implementations of several supervised metrics and scores for
    cluster analysis (i.e. they compare the cluster assignments with ground
    truth labels). These scores are agnostic to the clustering method and
    to the structure of the data: each function takes in a contingency table,
    or a vector of class labels and a vector of cluster assignments, and
    returns a score. A handy wrapper function, "super", returns a tidy one-row
    dataframe with all implemented stats for a cluster analysis result.
